Java EE 7 WebSocket Sample
==============

This project contains a simple WebSocket application which demonstrates the Java EE 7 technology.

These web sockets sample shows how to set up WebSocket Endpoints using annotations or programmatically. 

These samples exercise different operations on a WebSocket connection:

- Opening
- Reading 
- Writing 
- Closing 

Also shown is the use of encoders, decoders, the PathParam annotation, and Pong message processing. 

## Getting Started

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself!


## Running in Eclipse

1. Download and install [Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).
2. Create a new Liberty Profile Server.
3. Clone this repository.
4. Import the sample into Eclipse using *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects* option.
5. Edit the server.xml file located in the Servers -> DefaultServer folder in EnterpriseExporer. Copy the server.xml features from this project, found under the `<featureManager>` in /src/main/wlp/server.xml
6. Deploy the sample into Liberty server. Right click on the project and select *Run As -> Run on Server* option. Find and select the Liberty profile server and press *Finish*.
7. Go to: [http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/](http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/)

## Running with Maven

This project can be build with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in][] to automatically download and install Liberty profile runtime from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server. 

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the WebSocket application execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/](http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/).
