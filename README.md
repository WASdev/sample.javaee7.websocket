Java EE 7 WebSocket Sample [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.javaee7.websocket.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WASdev/sample.javaee7.websocket)
==============

This project contains a simple WebSocket application which demonstrates the Java EE 7 technology.

These web sockets sample shows how to set up WebSocket Endpoints using annotations or programmatically.

These samples exercise different operations on a WebSocket connection:

- Opening
- Reading
- Writing
- Closing

Also shown is the use of encoders, decoders, the PathParam annotation, and Pong message processing.

## Getting Started

Browse the code to see what it does, or build and run it yourself!


## Running in Eclipse

1. Download and install [Eclipse with the WebSphere Developer Tools](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/liberty-profile-using-eclipse/).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Import the sample into Eclipse using *File -> Import -> Maven -> Existing Maven Projects* option.
4. Right click on the project and select *Run As -> Run on Server* option. Find and select the Liberty profile server and press *Finish*.
5. Go to: [http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/](http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/)

## Running with Maven

This project can be built with [Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/). The project uses [Liberty Maven Plug-in] to automatically download and install Liberty profile runtime from the [Liberty repository](https://developer.ibm.com/wasdev/downloads/). Liberty Maven Plug-in is also used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server.

Use the following steps to run the application with Maven:

1. Execute full Maven build. This will cause Liberty Maven Plug-in to download and install Liberty profile server.
    ```bash
    $ mvn clean install
    ```

2. To run the server with the WebSocket application execute:
    ```bash
    $ mvn liberty:run-server
    ```

Once the server is running, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/](http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.websocket/).

## Running with Gradle

This project can also be built and run with [Gradle]. The provided `build.gradle` file applies the [Liberty Gradle Plug-in] and is configured to automatically download and install the Liberty Java EE7 Web Profile 7 runtime from Maven Central. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in has built-in tasks that can be used to create, configure, and run the application on the Liberty server.

Use the following steps to run the application with Gradle:

1. Execute the full Gradle build. The Liberty Gradle Plug-in will download and install the Liberty server.
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew clean build
    ```

2. To start the server with the Servlet sample execute:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyStart
    ```

    Alternatively, execute the run command:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyRun --no-daemon
    ```

Once the server has started, the application will be available under [http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.jsonp](http://localhost:9080/sample.javaee7.jsonp).

3. To stop the server, execute:
    ```bash
    $ ./gradlew libertyStop
    ```  

Please refer to the [ci.gradle] repository for documentation about using the Liberty Gradle Plug-in.
